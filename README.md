# WeekList: Your Weekly Task Manager (v0.1)

WeekList is a modern, intuitive task management application designed to help you organize your week with clarity and focus. It brings the effectiveness of the "Running To-do List"—a method traditionally used in paper notebooks—to a powerful digital format. By providing a weekly, high-level view of your tasks, WeekList helps you track progress, manage recurring work, and maintain focus on what matters most.

Built with Next.js, it provides a seamless and responsive experience for managing your personal and professional to-do lists. While the application is optimized for mobile devices, the user experience is most powerful on desktop, where the full weekly grid can be leveraged for deep work and planning.

## Key Features

*   **Weekly Grid View:** See your entire week at a glance. Track task statuses across each day to get a helicopter view of your workload and progress.
*   **Parent/Child Tasks:** Break down large projects into smaller, manageable steps with nested sub-tasks.
*   **Multiple Statuses:** Go beyond simple "done" or "not done." Track the state of each task with statuses like Planned, Completed, Rescheduled, or Cancelled.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Effortlessly prioritize your tasks by dragging and dropping them into the desired order.
*   **AI Task Breakdown:** Use the power of AI to automatically break down large, complex tasks into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks.
*   **Light & Dark Modes:** Switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable viewing experience at any time of day.
*   **Data Portability:** Easily import and export your task lists in Markdown (`.md`) format, giving you full control over your data.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** Efficiently manage tasks using hotkeys for adding, deleting, reordering, and indenting.

## Plans for the Future

WeekList is under active development. Here are some of the features on our roadmap:

*   **User Authentication:** Secure your task lists with user accounts.
*   **Database Support:** Move beyond local storage to a persistent cloud database, allowing you to sync your tasks across multiple devices.
*   **Cloud Hosting:** Deploying the application to a scalable hosting platform for reliable access anywhere.
