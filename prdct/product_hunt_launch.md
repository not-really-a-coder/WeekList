# Product Hunt Launch Comment Drafts

Here are three options for your first comment ("Maker's Comment") on Product Hunt. They all use your direct, pragmatist style, focusing on "busy people" and the specific pain of "tool maintenance."

## Option 1: The "Busy Professional" (Relatable & Problem-First)
*Recommended for igniting discussion around shared pain points.*

**Subject: Why another to-do list? Because maintaining one shouldn't be a job.**

Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I created **WeekList** for the "busy but unproductive"—the developers, freelancers, and multitaskers who are drowning in infinite backlogs.

We’ve all been there: you start a to-do list to get organized, but soon, **maintaining the list becomes another task in itself.** You spend more time grooming your backlog than actually doing the work. That’s not productivity; that’s admin.

WeekList is built on a simple premise: **Regain control of your time.**
*   **Weekly Grid**: Force prioritization. If it doesn't fit in the week, it doesn't exist (yet).
*   **Speed & Focus**: We stripped away the bloat. No complex tagging systems, no 15-click sub-menus. Just rapid tracking.
*   **Local-First**: Your data stays with you. You are in full control.

I built this for those who gave up on complex tools because they demanded time they didn't have.

**I’d love to hear from you:** What was the moment you realized your current to-do app was slowing you down instead of helping you?

Let's discuss! 👇

## Option 2: The "Visionary & Direct" (Bold & Concise)
*Recommended for a stronger stance on the "simplicity" philosophy.*

**Subject: Stop managing lists. Start managing your week.**

Hey everyone!

Most productivity tools have it backwards. They are designed to collect *everything*, creating infinite "running lists" that lead to anxiety and decision paralysis. They obscure the simple goal: **staying focused on what's important.**

Unnecessary complexity is the enemy of execution.

**WeekList** is the antidote. It’s a "cognitive anchor" designed to give you a high-level view of your week at a glance. It respects your time by being:
1.  **Fast**: Minimal friction to add and move tasks.
2.  **Private**: Local-first approach by default.
3.  **Real**: The weekly grid forces you to be realistic about your time.

We are building for the multitaskers balancing "work" and "life" who need a tool that works *for* them, not the other way around.

Check it out and let me know: Does the "Weekly View" help you feel more in control than a standard list?

## Option 3: The "Developer/Privacy" Angle (Technical & Pragmatic)
*Recommended if targeting a more technical audience who cares about data.*

**Subject: A local-first weekly planner for deep focus.**

Hi PH community!

I’m Leonid, and I’m excited to share **WeekList**.

I built this because I was tired of "productivity suites" that felt like bloated CRM software. I wanted a tool that felt like a physical weekly planner but with digital superpowers.

**WeekList** is designed for speed and privacy:
*   **Local-First Engine**: Your data lives on your device.
*   **Focus Mode**: One click to hide distractions and focus on the day's execution.
*   **Drag & Drop**: Intuitive scheduling that feels tactile.

It’s completely free to start (local storage), with paid sync/collaboration coming later for those who need it.

Give it a spin. If you're a busy professional who creates tasks faster than you can complete them, this might just be the "quiet" tool you've been looking for.

Feedback welcome!
