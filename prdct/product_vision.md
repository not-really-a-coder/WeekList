# Product Vision: WeekList

## 1. Vision Statement
**To empower individuals to regain control of their time by transforming overwhelming to-do lists into a clear, manageable weekly flow.**
WeekList aspires to be the cognitive anchor for professionals and students, helping them achieve "Deep Focus" through better visualization and time-effective planning.

## 2. Problem Statement
Traditional "running to-do lists" are flawed as they often introduce unnecessary complexity, obscuring the simple goal of staying focused on what's important.
*   **Overwhelming**: They grow indefinitely, leading to anxiety and decision paralysis.
*   **Lack of Context**: They don't show *when* a task fits into the week and how it aligns with other priorities.
*   **High Maintenance**: Requires excessive user attention, as maintaining the list becomes another task in itself—a major pain for busy people.

## 3. The Solution
WeekList provides a **High-Level Weekly Grid** that forces prioritization and realism.
*   **Visual Structure**: See the whole week at a glance.
*   **Speed & Focus**: Rapid tracking with minimal time investment, keeping you focused on execution.
*   **Focus-First Design**: Tools like "Focus Mode" hide distractions, keeping the user in the zone.

## 4. Target Audience
*   **Primary**: Knowledge workers, developers, freelancers, and multitaskers who need to keep focus on both "work" and "life" activities.
*   **Secondary**: Students with heavy course loads requiring weekly planning.
*   **Psychographic**: People who feel "busy but unproductive" and those who gave up on classical to-do lists because they demanded time they didn't have.

## 5. Key Differentiators
1.  **Weekly Grid vs. Infinite List**: Differentiates from Todoist/Things by forcing a temporal constraint (the week).
2.  **Local-First Approach**: Your data stays with you; you are in full control.
3.  **Visual Tactility**: Drag-and-drop interface that feels like a physical planner.

## 6. Strategic Pillars (Roadmap themes)
*   **Ubiquity**: Mobile App (React Native) to capture tasks on the fly.
*   **Reliability**: Cloud Sync & Auth ensuring data is safe and accessible everywhere.
*   **Collaboration**: Lists Sharing and Collaboration to enable teamwork and family planning.

## 7. Business Goals & Success Metrics (Draft)
*   **Goal**: Establish WeekList as the default "Weekly Planner" for productivity enthusiasts.
*   **Monetization**: Paid plans to enable synchronization (server storage) and AI features. Core local-first usage remains free.
*   **Key Metrics**:
    *   Daily Active Users (DAU)
    *   Task Completion Rate

## 8. Questions for Stakeholders
*   **Monetization Strategy**: Confirmed: Paid plans for Sync/AI.
*   **Collaboration**: Confirmed: Lists sharing is a strategic pillar.
*   **Platform Scope**: Equal priority for Web and Mobile.
