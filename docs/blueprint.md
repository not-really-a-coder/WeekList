## Core Features:

- Tasks Grouping: Group tasks in a parent / child structure.
- Multiple Statuses: Support multiple statuses for each task on a weekly view.
- Task Creation: Enable users to add new tasks to their weekly to-do list.
- Quick Task Completion: Allow users to quickly mark tasks as complete with a simple action.
- Task Reordering: Implement a drag-and-drop interface for users to reorder ongoing tasks according to priority.
- Completion History: Provide a section where users can view and review their history of completed tasks.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Calm blue (#64B5F6) to create a sense of tranquility and focus.
- Background color: Light blue (#E3F2FD), desaturated, matching the primary.
- Accent color: Soft green (#A5D6A7), analogous to blue but distinct in brightness and saturation, for completed tasks and positive actions.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. The combination keeps a clean and legible appearance, enhancing the functionality of task list and ensures readability.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different task categories or statuses. For example, a checkmark for completed tasks or a clock for tasks with deadlines.
- Employ a clean and intuitive layout with clear separation of tasks by status (active, completed). Use visual cues to differentiate task priorities.
- Incorporate smooth transitions when tasks are moved between lists or marked as complete to give some positive feedback to the user.
